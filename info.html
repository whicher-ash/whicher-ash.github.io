<p><font size="+1">My infographic project required research, so this was my most difficult project. Not only did I have to create my own illustrations, I also had to make sure my facts were correct.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was assigned to research a form of Communication Technology, and I chose to do speakers. My first step was to gather information from credible sources to ensure that my info was right. Once I had my research organized, I started coming up with design ideas.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I started my design process by deciding on a color scheme so the flow of the project was better. Next, I tried to decide on how to organize the content on the page, like where to put each section. I also picked what fonts I wanted for the body and headings in this step. Finally, I focused on creating minimalist illustrations based on real images and continuing to use the same color scheme in those illustrations.</font></p>
