<p><font size="+1">For my bookmark, or print project, I had to come up with a design that would appeal to elementary school students and could only use black and white coloring.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">First, I created some sketches to figure out what design I wanted to use. I was stuck between one nature and one space inspired design. I decided on nature because I felt it was more unique. I then created a rough layout in InDesign, made a few changes, then printed a laser printed copy of the bookmark to make sure it looked how I wanted it to.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Next, I had to manually print the bookmark using an off-set lithography press. Once they were dry, I was able to have them cut. After this process, they were successfully distributed to the students of Pequea Elementary School.</font></p>
